Details of Nitrogen Pressures and volumes.    For a new scheme we would want  
100 psi, to suit the nitrogen ring main. Current supply pressures from BOC 
are not relevant. Volume is 28-29,000 rm3/hr at Wilton and total of approx 
45,900rm3/hr when the other  sites are included.   This issue of supply to 
the other sites could be a problem as BOC are physically entrenched in the 
piped supply arrangements.
