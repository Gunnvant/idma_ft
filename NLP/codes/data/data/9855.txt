Leonard,

Thanks for the clarification.  None of the mailings received included our preprinted "deposit slips".

Do you want me to make a new request????

Susan, 
I DID NOT REQUEST ANY INFO. ON ELECTRONIC FUNDS.
WHEN I DEPOSITED THE FOUR STAR MONEY I ASKED THEM TO SEND YOU FOURSTAR 
DEPOSIT SLIPS.
