here is another request for a direct EOL data feed.  We should figure out how we want to respond to such inquiries.  I have never heard of this company before.

Good Day to you.
I would like to introduce myself and my company.
Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.
Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
companies.
One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
I go about getting it.
We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
this respect.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

With kind regards

Graham Mansfield
