Subject: Question?

John,

Do you think we need to see about sending an IT Tech for you and Maggi on 
Friday to make sure everything is working okay?   If we do, we would have to 
pay for their travel expenses.

It would be beneficial to you instead of having to be on the phone with IT 
for any problems.

Let me know.

-Ina
