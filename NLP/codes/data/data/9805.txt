
Darren,

ENA and Forest Oil have entered into 5 trades, which have all been confirmed under an Omnibus Confirmation format.  All 5 trades did not include any credit provisions; however, Forest Oil has sent back comments -- some of which are of a credit nature.

Therefore, please advise as to your call on the following Credit requests:

	1.	Enron Corp. Guaranty to be provided to guarantee ENA's obligations under the trades.
	2.	Events of Default re: Bankruptcy -- change Section 3(d)'s reference of 30 days to 60 days.

Let me know your thoughts.

  

Regards,
