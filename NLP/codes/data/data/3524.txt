maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent 
historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right 
now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to 
prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your 
markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is 
that relevant.

i was reading something interesting last week somewhere on states coping with 
the coming summer---the report was on the amount of ice -not huge enough from 
this winter to provide enough water for hydroelectricity during 
summer.farmers were encouraged to cultivate crops that consume less water-the 
first thing i can  think of is low sul fueloil as natgas will be well 
supported-thus european lsfo will be arbg to the states.just my 
thought-hi/low play worth watching
