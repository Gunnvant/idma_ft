did not, but I went to my wine locker and picked out 12 bottles for the weekend so I think we're okay unless you're taking some to your friends.  I'll call you when I'm ready and we'll figure it out.

of course, I'm just tagging with you guys.  Did you ever go to Christopher's?  I might go pick up some wine - any requests or recommendations?  And where do you want to leave from?

Is it okay to leave around 3:00?
