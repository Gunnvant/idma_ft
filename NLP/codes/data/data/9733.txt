Dona,

Ok as to evening drinks.

As for Saturday, walking with Lilly while you get your hair done is a good idea.  Lunch or something would work for me, but just remembered that I have a facial 4:30pm on Saturday.

We will go somewhere every night, so I will keep you in touch. Saturday
morning I have a hair appt.  Maybe you and Lilly can go on a walk and take
the bear while I do that and then we can have lunch or something.
