thats my approach-i know youre doing well but i have no  idea how well. let me
put it to you this way completely between you and me. i have every expectation
of making myself about a a myn this year(dont want to jinx myself). ive herd
suggestions that this new deal cud be better cuz of the guarantees + bonus. i
dont know yet, hasnt been offered or even discussed directly. but if it does 
and
its very good they gonna need a ngas guy in houston. i think we could put
together a hell of a us team. ill let you know if/when i find out more if that
interests you. wouldnt be alot different from the job role you are currently
in..
