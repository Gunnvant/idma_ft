
I loved seeing you so much this weekend.  It makes me wonder how I lived
without you.  I am glad that things at work have calmed down and you can
get out more.  I can't wait to see Lilly this Friday night.  I love your
BEAR!  I told David all about her and he said that he would love to run her
while we walk. Have a great day!
