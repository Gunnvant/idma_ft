Louis:

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.
