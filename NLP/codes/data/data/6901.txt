Savita:
I'm going to need an additional report daily for the next couple weeks: for the top 50 counterparties a summary of total EOL volumes and phys gas volumes for average of rolling 30 days, average of rolling 5 days, and previous day with volume differentials in percent relative to 30 day average.  For instance :


TOTAL VOLUMES	
		Previous day		5 day			30 day
Aquilla		240  	-20%		330	+10%		300
El Paso		275 	+10%		200	-20%		250


US GAS PHYS FWD FIRM <= 1 MONTH

				BUY							SELL
		Previous day		5 day			30 day		Previous day		5 day			30 day
Aquilla		24  	-20%		33	+10%		30		16  	-20%		24	+20%		20	
El Paso		30 	+20%		20	-20%		25		5 	-50%		10	0		10


Please advise how quickly you can put this together.
