i took a week and a half off during the same time that Bo Collins of EL Paso left so naturally I am going to El paso.  I'm not going anywhere unfortunately.  I'm in for July 31 if you've got them

It would mean divorce court.  I went last night.  But I have got them for 31 July, if we you would like to schedule in advance.  Thanks for the invite but I will have to pass on this one.  By the way, there are all sorts of rumors about you and where you will be working.

regards,

Paul
