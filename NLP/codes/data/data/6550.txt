yet his price forecast from last week is 2.60ish for next summer...is that the struggle between bullish next summer but coming out of the winter with a lot of gas in the ground?

wrong assumption--he intends to come out as a big bull at this year's october conference --sees production treadmill scenario again--expects tightness to rear its head in h2-02. they have reduced their dwgom numbers in 03-05. he is still bearish this year thats it--he thinks time to get long is at 2.00$-----
