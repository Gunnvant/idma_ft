Hi Stephanie,

Can I get test ID's for Rob Stalford and Harry Arora. They should have access to all the US  Power Products in test.

HI Melba,

Can you set up Financial Power Product types in test and getting it mapped to the financial swap product type. If this could be done sometime before Monday it will be great. Thanks.
