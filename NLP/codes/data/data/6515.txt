I'll be here until tomorrow afternoon, then off to Waco to see my mom.  I just got back to my desk after being in meetings all day.  Who knows how long I'll be here tonight and I have a shit load of work to do tomorrow.  Why do I work here again?

What's up with you?  I bought some guest to your floor today but you weren't around.  And I have on boots with curly hair.

Take care, MSA

Oh, let's chat about Guggenheim next week.  Are you going on the 17th too?
