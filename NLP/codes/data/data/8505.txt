Hi Harry:
 
It was nice talking to you on Saturday and I am sorry I was a bit brief as we had to load up our stuff in the UHaul truck and move that day. We are now in NJ at my sister's place. My new contact details are 
 
Harnek Minhas
116 Rico Drive N
Morganville, NJ 07751
Tel: 732-591 5597

I'll give you a call one of these days and we will chat. Let me know when you are coming to NJ. We should get together.
