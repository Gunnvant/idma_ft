Our Sacramento correspondent just exited a news conference from
Gov. Davis, FERC chair Hoecker, DOE Sectretary Richardson and
others outlining several emergency measures, including west-wide
price cap. As soon as her report is filed, we'll be sending it to your
attention. I expect that will be around 2:30 pm.
