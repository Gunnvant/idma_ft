John & Mike,

Could you please fill out the attach spreadsheet COB today?  There is one 
swap term and one collar term.

It looks like we are getting close to a finance deal and are working with 
John Thompson in the finance group.  The outline quotes would be a buy out of 
existing deals on Enron's books.


Thanks,

Sheetal
