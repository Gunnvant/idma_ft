Russ:

A couple of questions
1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season  report.   There seem to be a lot 
of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?



Thanks
JF
