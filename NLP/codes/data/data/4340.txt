Jennifer,
I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

Jeff,
The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for 
all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are 
at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.
