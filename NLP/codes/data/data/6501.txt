We, at the weather desk, are designing a product that pays with gas-price exposure (HDD products that pay in financial equivalents to MMBtus). The solution for this product requires the trading in gas and in weather.

We are in a point to establish the real dynamic of trading, which products to trade. We would like to have some input. To whom should we talk to have this guidance?

Thanks for the help,
