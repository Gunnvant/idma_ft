Subject: FT-Denver book on EOL

Phil or Paul:

Please forward this note to Torrey Moorer or Tara Sweitzer in the EOL 
department.  It must be sent by you.  

Per this request, we are asking that all financial deals on EOL be bridged 
over to the FT-Denver book instead of the physical ENA IM-Denver book.

Thanks in advance.
