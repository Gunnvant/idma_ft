Contact Andy Rowe at 713 966 2107.   
They are a medium term fundamental energy player.  They have never indicated 
any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may 
change.  They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval 
yet.

John- can you give me the name of your business line contact there, job 
function and phone number?  Also, whatever you know about their trading 
style- are they macro, program, technical?  Would they be interested in the 
same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them 
ideas from our various trading groups??  Do they want to trade on-line or are 
they already??

Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I 
can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading...

Talk to you Monday,
CA
