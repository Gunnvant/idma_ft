Thanks so much for getting this to me today.  

In the future please gray-shade the "expired" and "annuity" classifications as well as "terminated."

Thanks

All,

Attached is the latest version of the "Default Demand Log" updated with those comments & responses received as of March 11th & 12th.  As before, all new information is presented in a "bolded" font.   As an added convenience -- all "Terminated" Counterparty entries have beeen shaded for easier tracking.
