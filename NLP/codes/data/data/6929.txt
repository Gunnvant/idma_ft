Things are okay.  May be much better in a week or two.  Can you email me an update of how the 3 hedge funds are doing.  I may have another chunk of money to invest should you have any good opportunities lying around.  Still mainly interested in alternative investments with you.  Also, can you confirm my address.  I have moved recently and dont know if you have the new one.  2000 Bagby #15403; Houston 77002.

I just wanted to touch base and see how you're doing through all of this.  I
expect that you're still gainfully employed, given your position within the
core energy trading business.  Let me know if you need anything from us.
