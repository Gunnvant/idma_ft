We have the whole curve out.  The nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement.  our volume is pretty normal at this point.

John,
I'm down in Brazil and I understand we are trading Oct fixed price forwards without the NYMEX being open? is this the case?  How much volume? Are we trading out into the back of the curve?

I shouldn't say I'm surprised, but my jaw is hitting the floor.  Shit, great job!
