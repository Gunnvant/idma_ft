Dona,

I had really great time, and hope the remainder of your weekend went well.

I would love to join you all this week for drinks with the girls, just let me know the evening.

I usually see my trainer on Tuesday & Thursday, but could skip Thursday if that would be one of the drink nights.

Also Bear & I would love to go walking again sometime before Lilly leaves.

Susan

It was such a treat to see you on Friday night and Saturday. Please let me
know if you want to get out again this week.  Lilly leaves on Sunday.
Lot's of love to you, Dona
