Phillip,

Enclosed is a draft of the revised Escrow Agreement based on the Lender's
comments.  I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement
provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland.
We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event
Agape fails to receive reimbursement.  Please contact me at (512) 370-2836
or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns.  Thanks.
