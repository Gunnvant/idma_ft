Tell them to calm down.  I'm going to start clearing amro, tfs, and carr trades through them as well.  I will do a new xpit to offset some of the new positions that will lower the margin in the short term.

John - a lot of trades other than energy trades were xpitted to Fimat on Friday from ABN.  Fimat NY  is now upset and wants to restrict our trading with Fimat from 20 million to 11 million.  Do you know who asked for this xpitting to be done?  Sarah
