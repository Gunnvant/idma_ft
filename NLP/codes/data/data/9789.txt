Kelly,

I have not provided you with an updated list, so I hope you used my one from last year--it should suffice.

Also, please be advised, according to my duties as the Junior League's Outside Board Rep, I am not permitted to assist with any fund raising activities.  Therefore, I will attend the Board meeting, but will not stay to write notes.

Sorry,

Susan Bailey
