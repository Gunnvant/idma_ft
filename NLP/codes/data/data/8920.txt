The Fundamentals Group is moving Database servers and the existing EnData 
Excel Add-In
needs to be changed.  

If you use Endata, please follow the directions below at your leisure.

(1) Select Tools->Add-ins from the Excel Menu Bar
(1) Uncheck existing Endata box (if it's there).
(2) Press the "browse" button
(3) Select P:\Fundamentals\Production\Endata\Endata.xla
(4) Respond NO to "Copy  'EnData.xla' to Microsoft Excel Add-In Library"
(5) press OK

if EnData mysteriously disappears from you menu, follow these directions 
to add it to you menu again.  

The old EnData points to the old database which will be deleted sometime soon.

Thanks!
Cooper
