I am glad we finally heard from Kevin Kolb.  I would like to close the book on the stagecoach.

I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday.  I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible.  

Sorry to hear about your wife's condition.  She will be in our prayers.

Phillip

Phillip, 
      I received an email from Kevin Kolb with comments on the settlement  
agreement that i had prepared and sent out quite a while ago. I will contact  
him and try to reach agreement on all points. I will be at MD Anderson this  
afternoon with my wife - she is starting chemo today - but I will check my  
email tonight and tomorrow. If you have any questions or comments, just leave  
a note and I will respond. Thanks.  Jacques
