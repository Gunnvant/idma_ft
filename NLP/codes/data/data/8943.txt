Following today's conference call, Mona and I drafted a revised outline of 
our comments in response to the Investigation. We will file a statement  on 
8/14 at the CPUC. If you have any concerns regarding the outline, please 
provide comments ASAP. We will be circulating a Draft Statement prior to 
filing for additional comments. 

See the attachment for the revised outline
