Hi Harry, 

      I hope you had good weekend.  The weather in College Station (for the Aggie football game) & Austin was beautiful & sunny.  We never saw the rain. 

      I am sending you my resume for any contacts you may have within Enron or anyone else in the Industry.  I am very interested in this industry in which I can utilize my communication, interpersonal skills and business experience.  I posses strong leadership, motivation skills and long-term client relations that would be of great value to any organization.  I am adept to working in a fast-pace environment and Team oriented group to reach company and personal objectives.  I am keenly interested in making a strong contribution and commitment to a company in the energy industry and my decision to pursue my goals within energy.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials with you or any contacts you may have in a personal interview.  Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. 

      I hope to see you & Nicole this Thursday night around 6:30.  Thank you again for your help.
