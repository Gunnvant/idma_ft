	Dear all,

	Today is my last day with Enron.   You have my wishes for continued success and my thanks making Enron a more interesting place to work over the almost 9 years that I have been here.   I hope to stay in touch in the future.   Should you wish to contact me by email,  sgibner@hotmail.com should work.

	Thanks,

		Stinson
