Well, that was a quick vacation!    Monday is NX1, for some reason I was thinking NX1 was Friday....will reschedule.    Thanks.

Since I still have 3 weeks vacation remaining, I've scheduled 2 days vacation for Monday and Tuesday (Oct 29 and 30), and I'll take 3 more days before the end of the year and just rollover 2 weeks into next year.     I'll inform the appropriate parties.    Thanks!   

P.S......still averaging between 0-2 changes per month!!!
