I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer 
buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.

Don't know about the front 2 months, but gut feel is that april thru oct at 
approximately 50% seems like something to own (although I hate flat vol 
curves).  What do you think (long, flat, or short)?
