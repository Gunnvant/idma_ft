
New Power Products on ICE!!

On Friday, October 26 IntercontinentalExchange will launch Hourly Power as =
well as 2nd, 3rd, 4th Week strips.  The Hourly Power will be offered for al=
l the West Power hubs and for PJM in the East.  These new markets will have=
 to be manually added to portfolios.  The 2nd, 3rd, 4th Week strips will be=
 available for all Power hubs currently available on the Exchange and will =
be automatically added to portfolios containing the Next Day strip for a pa=
rticular hub.

Credit must be set under the Financial Power credit filter for the PJM Hour=
ly and under the Power credit filter for the West Hourly markets.  Hourly P=
ower markets can be arranged in chronological order in the Portfolio Editor=
 window.  Please call your ICE representative if assistance is needed.
