Hello all,

Several of you have inquired who would be attending the May 17 Guggenheim 
event on our behalf, whether Enron employees or guests.  While this list is 
always in motion, this should give you a good idea. 

I'm glad that each of you will be attending and hope that both you and your 
guests enjoy.  Please call me on my cell phone at 713-515-9208 if you need 
anything.  Otherwise, I will see you on the 17th at the Guggenheim.

Take care, Margaret Allen
