
Hi,


	The slides for yesterday's options session may be found on the following drive:

			m:power2\options\power options course notes\Introduction to Power Options Lecture Notes (11-19-01).ppt


		Dave Forster will let you know the time and place for the next options session.  


		By popular demand, it will be on spread options (crack, heat, spark, etc) and a few real case studies.




Thanks,
Iris
