Here are the URL's for all three LiveLink instances

The URL to get into Livelink from your Internet Explorer browser id is:
	ELU 	 http://www.generalquarters.com/livelink/livelink.exe 
	Corp	 http://nahou-kmcprm01p/livelink/livelink.exe
	ENA 	 http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ena/livelink.exe
 
The logon ID is the same as the Enron network ID. The password is currently the same as the ID. 
Please change your password on all but ENA. ENA is linked to your Network ID . 
To change a LiveLink password goto the 'Change Password' option from within the 'GOTO' pulldown from menu on the LIvelink 'Enterprise' screen.
