JA;
Six months ago we spoke about Tony moving to a commercial role. He followed 
your advice and has gained some experience in structuring. He approached me 
about joining the middle marketing group. I think he would an asset. I think 
we would bring him as an associate with the hope that he would move up to 
manager in 6 months.

Please let me know your thoughts. I would like to use you as a reference with 
Fred and Craig.
Thanks
JF
