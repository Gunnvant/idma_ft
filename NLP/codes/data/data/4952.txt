Hello everybody,

The date of our next meeting is approaching fast, and I  wanted to make sure 
that we have not forgot about the action items that need to happen before 
January 4th.  Please let me know your specific plan and target dates, by 
which each action item will be accomplished.  It is very important that we 
stay on schedule.  I will do my best to help any of you make things happen by 
January 4th.
