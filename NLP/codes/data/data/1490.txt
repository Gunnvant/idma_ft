We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Thanks,

Mike
