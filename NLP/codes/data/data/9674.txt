Susan,

The contact telephone for Rochester seems to have an extra number (typo). Can you tell me what it should be.

Thank you,
Maria

Use the attached file to update our matrix w/ demand letter dates.  Also, you'll find more "Contract Type" information in the attached file.  Check for any other data that we might need as well.  

Thx for your help.
