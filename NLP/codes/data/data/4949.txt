Ron Howard:

I just confirmed back with Shirley Vauter that 1:30 PM -3:00 PM on Tuesday, 
December 12th is fine for the meeting between Larry Kellner, Jeff Shankman, 
and their teams.  Thank-you for your flexibility in rescheduling this meeting 
from December 11th to December 12th per Jeff Shankman's request.

I will follow up shortly with logistical details.
