Market Participants,

Attention: Settlements and Scheduling Personnel

Your participation is requested in the second iteration of 10-Minute
Settlement Market Simulation.

As communicated on 7/20/00, the ISO has postponed the August 1, 2000,
implementation of 10-minute settlements in order to accommodate additional
end-to-end testing and market simulation.  The ISO's new target for
implementation is the last week of August, 2000, contingent upon the
successful completion of the second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation
and ISO's 10 day written notice to FERC.

The second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on
Tuesday, August 1, 2000.  The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference
call on Thursday, July 27, from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m., to summarize the status of
the first Market Simulation, discuss the second Market Simulation logistics,
and review the Market Simulation Plan.

All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this simulation
to identify any outstanding issues that may affect implementation for
Scheduling Coordinators and the ISO.

Please respond to Cathy Young at cyoung@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on Friday if
you intend to participate.  The remainder of this message contains the
kickoff meeting Agenda, Market Simulation Schedule, and necessary system set
up documentation for the simulation.

Attached please find the following documentation for your use in setting up
your systems for Market Simulation.

a.  ADS Market Simulation Configuration
b.  ADS_PAR Installation
c.  Software Configuration for SI Development System

It is important that you use this information to prepare your system setup
ASAP.  It may be necessary to have your IT department allow traffic through
your firewalls to and from the ADS market simulation IP address and port.
Please refer to the ADS Market Simulation Configuration document for
detailed instructions.

If you are interested in verbally receiving RMR pre-dispatches during the
market simulation, please let Cathy Young know when you sign up.

You may contact Christine Vangelatos at cvangelatos@caiso.com or (916)
351-2142 if you have any questions or concerns regarding ADS or SI
configuration.
