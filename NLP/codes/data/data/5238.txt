Subject:	Hello from David Hsu

Mike,

It was nice to meet you last night.  At PanCanadian, I'm the gas options
trader, where much of my work is focused on clearing stuff for customer
business.  If you have the opportunity, let me know of any new options
products you guys are working on that I might be able to sell to our
producer, pipeline, and LDC customers for hedging.
