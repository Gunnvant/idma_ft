Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey
