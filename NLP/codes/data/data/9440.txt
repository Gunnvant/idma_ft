I'm so glad you want to help!

I'll put you down as wanting to help and I'll let you know what happens with 
the meeting.

The tentative dates are:
Information Session Sep 18
Interviews  Nov 8 Reception
   Nov 9 First Round, on campus
   Nov 10 Second Round, on campus

Super Saturday for Wharton folks will be the first weekend of December.

I'll definitely keep you posted.  We've had people fly from Portland before, 
so it's definitely possible to get you out for events or interviews if your 
schedule allows.

Suzanne,
 I'm a '97 graduate and interested in recruiting this year. However, I'm out 
in Portland, so I will be unable to attenfd any meetings in Houston. Let me 
know how I can help. I would like to go out there when you go. Let me know 
what our schedule is. Thanks.
