Yes I have.
I'm getting all the details on the 4 options I have with the project:
Terminate
Postpone until Q1
Postpone until deal Closure
continue as planned.

When I get this info I'll talk with you about it. We're currently about to end Phase 2 (approx 50% completed).

Tim,

Have you considered reducing the scope or terminating the Accenture project to conserve cash?  Where are we in terms of %complete?
