Greg's always on vacation.  You need to teach him some work habits.  Next 
Tuesday will work.

Hi John!

Greg and Mary are on vacation this week in Germany.  May I put you on the 
calendar for Tuesday of next week?  Greg will travel to Philly on Monday.

Hey,
Can Greg fit me in for about 30 minutes tomorrow afternoon?
