ORDER BY MARCH 8 AND SAVE ON A PAIR OF SUPERB SCIENCE COURSES!
======================================

Dear Harry Arora:

Here's a terrific opportunity to boost your scientific literacy by enjoying video lectures featuring two of the finest science teachers in America today.

Between now and March 8, you can order BOTH Prof. Alex Filippenko's "Understanding the Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy" (40 video lectures) and Prof. Seth Shostak's series on "The Search for Intelligent Life in Space" (12 video lectures) for a single low price of $229.90 plus $20 shipping, handling, and insurance.

That's a savings of more than $300 off list, and works out to less than $5 per lecture--an excellent value for your learning dollar.

Neither course requires any special science or math background; both are geared to the intelligent general student.

This is a limited-time offer good only till March 8. Take advantage of it today. Click on https://www.teachco.com/ttcstore/Special030101a.htm.
