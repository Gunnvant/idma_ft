johnny,

my new deal p/l from yesterday (tue) looked a little on the high side,?so i 
asked my?guy to double check my deals.? he checked them today and said they 
all checked out.? but, i re-checked?my new gas deals and saw that you filled 
me on 100 n-q at 4.32 instead of 5.32.? i'll have my boy fix it so it'll show 
up tomorrow (thur).? $2 jumbos from me to you!

fletch

p.s.? thanks for all your help with our gas business.?it gives us a 
tremendous advantage against our rivals. you're the king even if you don't 
notice a $2 million error on one trade.
