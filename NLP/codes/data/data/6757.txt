btw, thanks for sending me the email this morning rather than waiting until next week to tell me about Maggi.  small steps.  soon you'll be writing reviews and actually attending PRC-i won't know what to do w/myself.

our legal is talking w/el paso legal and lavo is trying to talk to maggi.  i'll let you know if i get any more info.
