Hello OBRs 

For those of you who have turned in or emailed your questionnaire, THANKS.  For you others, please turn it in or email ASAP.  I will be out of town through Mar. 17, but if you email me, I can mail it to you (if you can't download this). 

Many thanks, Tami Grubb

Well hello again JLH-OBRs 

I have been inspired to put this OBR questionnaire on my computer and now am emailing to you to fill out and return to me. 

I am sending it as a Word document.  I can also save as WordPerfect or Unicode, if you need that.  Just let me know. 

Many thanks, Tami Grubb
