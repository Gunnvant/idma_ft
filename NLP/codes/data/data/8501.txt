Hi Kristi

Hope things are going well. I got your email address from Andrea, who also told me you'd moved to Pittsburgh.  Enron implosion is in full progress and I think this week, we will be left with 30% of our original size.  On the gas power and trading, there are numerous groups who are trying to work out other opportunities, but we will have to wait and see.

Keep me posted on what you are upto.
