Hi again,

	Just to clarify. The headquarters for Progress is in San Francisco.

	However, their fund managers are all over the U S and a few outside the U S.

Ciao,
Iris

Hi Harry,

	Hope you had a good trip to New York and got lots of business from the hedge fund managers you met with.

	Just an idea:  I was chatting with Jaime about some friends of mine who are the founders and executives of Progress Investment Management (a "Fund of Funds" in San Francisco).  The last time I chatted with them they had between 3-4 billion USD under management via various fund managers.

	Some of their funds are invested in hedge funds and in venture capital funds.

	Do you think it would be worthwhile to make their acquaintance regarding our products?

Thanx,
Iris
