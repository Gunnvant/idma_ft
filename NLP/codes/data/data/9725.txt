We received the cash PSCC promised to pay.  As best we can determine they are paid in full and their financial positions are now expired.

Susan: Please note both "paid in full" and "expired" on the Demand Letter Log. 

Maria: Please reclassify this CP as "expired" on our list.  When you rerun the Apr02-forward MTM this CP should show $0.  If not, let's investigate.

Thanks all.
