
Ok.  I will pick Lilly up at the airport at 2pm. She wants to go to SAK's
because it is a double-discount employee weekend.  I thought that the mall
would be slower today than on Saturday.  Call me on my cell and I will tell
you where we will be. I cannot decide where to go.  Somewhere that has a
good bar where we can all talk.  My cell # is 713-540-0447! I can't wait to
see you tonight! Bye for now, Dona
