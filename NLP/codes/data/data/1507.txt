Team
Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).

We need examples of:
Cap (Call Option)
Floor
Collar

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.
