John,

Are you kidding!  I'm lonely as hell up here.  When Greg is out, I have no one to talk too.  Missing those trading floor days.  Stop by any time and check out the view from here.  Greg will be back in the office tomorrow.  I'm sure he'd welcome a friendly face after two days with those brutal analysts!

Just wanted to thank you for the astros playoff tix.  Thanks for thinking of me.  Maybe you'll invite me up to see your new digs before the move....
