
Continue to look for setup to go long crude.  For today,  ET generates a buy signal if December trades under 2187 and closes over  2210.  For the January contract, it must trade below 2203 and close over  2225.  If crude does not close up on the day, then a buy signal can occur  tomorrow by trading above today's high.  Will update any new parameters as  necessary.
