Laurie,

This is a holiday week for people here -- as our Thanksgiving Day will be on Thursday, November 22nd.

Consequently, Anne will not be back until Thursday, November 29th.

We are still awaiting word from our Credit people as to your latest comments.

Susan,
I am back in the office today, and would be happy to discuss any progress that has been made with Enron's review of the ISDA documentation. Please give me a call when you get a chance (441-294-3007). Thanks!
Laurie
