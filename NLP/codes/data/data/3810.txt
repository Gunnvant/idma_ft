sorry didnt respond to your message.   don't know how to do that instant 
messenger thing anymore.  volume very, very light.  most of stated volume in 
spreads and TAS.  No one seems to want to be in the office this week.   
Everyone wants to get this year over with.  
Keep pumping in the fundamental info.   very good stuff and i'm not getting 
it anywhere else.
