  Market Participants
  SC Settlements Contacts

  After the 10 Minute Settlement Market Simulation conference
call on Friday August 25,  Market Participants' concerns of readiness were
brought before the ISO Officers.  The Officers discussed these concerns as
well as the two previous delays (June and August) in implementing Ten Minute
Settlements.  Weighing all of these issues, the ISO believes that there is a
compelling need to put a pricing structure in place to realize a substantial
saving in real time energy costs.

  Therefore, the ISO has decided to continue with the Ten
Minute Settlement implementation date of September 1, 2000.
