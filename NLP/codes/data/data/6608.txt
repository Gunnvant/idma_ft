With the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is sacrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.
