Under new rules instituted this year by Commissioner Bud Selig, an umpire can automatically eject a pitcher if he believes he's throwing at a batter. He does not have to issue a warning before an ejection. 
Fletcher did not warn Mann for hitting Gonzalez or Cordova. 
"The umpire said Bartolo threw the ball at his head and that's an automatic ejection," said Manuel. "But the ball missed his head by three feet. It tipped off his bat." 
Colon said he wasn't trying to hit Servais. 
"I will protect my teammates," said Colon, speaking through bullpen coach/interpreter Luis Isaac. "I can hit anyone I want at any time. That's why I feel bad. I wasn't trying to hit him. The ball slipped." 
Fryman defended his pitcher. 
"At no point, do I approve of throwing at someone's head," said Fryman. "But that pitch did not surprise anyone in the ballpark. Bartolo should not have been ejected. There should have been an immediate warning to each bench.
