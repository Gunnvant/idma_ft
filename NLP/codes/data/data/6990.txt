Dear John

In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you yesterday, I
propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it includes no
options at all.

short 1660 May 2002 futures

Please understand that this entire affair is making me as uncomfortable as
it is clearly making you.

Kind regards
Kevin R Davis
