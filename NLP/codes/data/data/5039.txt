I assume you no longer plan to come to Belize, but in case you might
be wavering, I've made slightly different plans.  I'm going to San Pedro/Ambergris
Caye where there is more activity (http://ambergriscaye.com/).  And if
you want to come but are hesitant because of me, then don't be.   I would
simply enjoy your company diving.

And if you are definately not coming, then you owe me a birthday dinner
before I leave :)
