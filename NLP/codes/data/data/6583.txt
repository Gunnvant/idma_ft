Subject: Xmas Skiing 



Think we're settled on Xmas week to go skiing. If this not good, reply via email (Dad, you can phone).

Therefore we're looking at 22nd to 29th (possibly 30th??) Dec. 

Location; Mart and I not got strong view other than not daft money, and would like nice scenery and maybe a few shops for Mart. i don't know enough about where we are likely to get good snow or not, Jim/Jenny might better advise.

In view of our restriction re. dates we might have limited choice anyway. I will have a look on internet, Jim/Jenny would you do same. Mum and Dad, might be better if you go to travel agents.

Suggest we touch base over weekend to review options.
