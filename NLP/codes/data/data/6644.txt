Subject:	All Carr Energy business is being handled in Chicago

Because of the tragedy in New York, all accounts are being handled out of
Chicago.
Please direct any questions to Mike Heffner, Rob Vujtech and I here in
Chicago at 312-762-1010 or 800-326-5493. We are attempting to contact every
customer today.
Any one who receives this email and dealt with our New York office, I will
need your telephone numbers.
Thank you for your help in this matter.
Scott
