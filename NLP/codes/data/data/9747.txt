I spoke w/ Brian Russo today to determine whether he sent payment as he indicated on 3/13/02.  He admitted that BG&E dropped the ball and would get the payment via wire to ENA tomorrow.  He also said there are a few invoices wherein ENA owes BG&E.  If they are all post-petition he is planning to net the amounts.

I provided Brian w/ wire instructions.  

Brian again stated he is willing to pay default interest when the rate is provided.  That issue is in my court.

Susan: DLL update please.

Cynthia:  Hopefully this money shows up this time.
