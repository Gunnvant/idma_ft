Subject:	Contract Listing

Per your request, attached the a list of the documents/contracts we have for each asset (per the file categories indicated).  Note that some spreadsheets contain more than one asset as this report was created by country.  In these cases, I highlighted each asset in different colors to indicate where one project ends and another begins.  

Please advise of any questions.
