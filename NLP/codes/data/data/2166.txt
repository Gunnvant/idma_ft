Phillip:

Here is info about the party I am having.  It's has been a long time I
haven't seen you, so try to come (I know you usually do not).  Try to bring
Hunty and some other old timers.  Don't worry about the fact that it is to
celebrate the "Launching of True Quote and EOL link", it was supposed to
take place on June 9th, but we got flooded out!  I am inviting bunch of
friends and few colleagues and some of the EOL people I work with.

My phone at work is 713 622 5243
