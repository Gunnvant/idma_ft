Hey Liz,
Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.

My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work 
better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more 
user-friendly.

On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a 
flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for 
half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't 
expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.    
Thanks,
John

John,

We are testing the Nextel phone for company usage.  What did you think of the 
phone?
