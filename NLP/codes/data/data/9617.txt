
Leonard,

WELCOME BACK !!!!!   Hope you and Dorothy had a pleasant trip to Germany???   Hope all is well with Kasie??? I would love to hear all about it.

While you were gone, Maria Pirro contacted me -- she is with West Penn Appraisers, Inc. ("WPA").  She faxed their fee schedule relating to the various Sciullo Properties and signed off on my approval as to costs, so WPA is beginning their work.

FYI:	I have sent to WPA the monies for the Burger King appraisal as well as the Willow Farms lots.  However, there are some properties for which Four Star or Dan & I are not a party to.   Therefore, the payment of those appraisals must be handled probably by you or my Dad.

I will fax the WPA fee Schedule, so you know what properties constitute WPA's idea of the "Sciullo Properties".

Once again, welcome back.

Susan
