VOM - I think we did $2, Brandon should be able to confirm, I know it was 7x24, with 8 hour min run
Re size - our interest is atmost 250 MW
 
Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For example we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for ECAR.

Harry:
 
Received your voice mail from last night.  Just to make sure I've got it right: bid is $3.00/Kw-mo; Heat Rate is 7,000.
 
Re: size - do we want 250MW, or more?
Re: VOM - is $2.00/MWh what we have in mind?
Re:  Availability - is it 7x24 or 5x16.
 
Didn't understand the comment on capacity.  If we've got the call, don't we also have the capacity?
 
Thanks,
 
Greg
