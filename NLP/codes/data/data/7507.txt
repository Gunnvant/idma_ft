John,

I heard from Wes Colwell that you had been appointed by Lavorato to layout 
the sixth floor for gas.  This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement 
of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six.  I have taken 6 spaces but I need two 
more.  The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied 
by the Central Region.  I would like to move these individuals to two spots 
right across from their current location (e35 & e36).


For your information, the current six spots that I have are :  e17, e18, e21, 
e22, e23 and e24.

Please call when you can.  Good luck trading...

Regards, Mrha
