This is a list of common mistakes.  However, as the group works together to create exercises and scenarios for the simulation many additional ideas will be generated.  I don't want to hold up this document.  I just want everyone to be aware that it is not all inclusive.

Gentlemen
Please take  a look at the attached document. Provide me with your final input, if any, in so that I can give Accenture Sign off acceptance. This document includes input Accenture received or derived from yesterday's Design Scope meeting.

Tim do you still want to include on this document the issue around "Not listening to "Customer'/ Misjudging customers needs & risk"? Or do you feel it fits into one of the 8 high level buckets listed in the attachment. 

I request everyone's input by COB, Wednesday 9/26 in so that if changes are needed we can still get final sign off by COB Friday 9/28. Thanks
