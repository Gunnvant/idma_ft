We are riding again tonight ~6:30pm at Memorial - pacing - Andy Walker's leading 20 laps at 23mph. We can switch off behind him.

Thanks Andy.

Sorry I missed the biking - had a plumbing disaster, but was able to fix it myself!!

Camera is the same resolution as yours, I believe - 3.3 Megapixel.  The lens was updated - lower F-stop - lets more light in.

Let me know about Pho!

I'm doing great!  Tina and I just got back from a trip to Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks.  Check out this photo:

 << File: test0108.JPG >> 
Tina bought me the Olympus c-3040 for my birthday - latest version of the one you and Jeff have.

I don't have a bike, but will see if I can borrow Dan's.

If I don't make it Monday night, how about Pho on Tuesday?

It is dark but they light it up pretty good.  How are you buddy? Do you have a road bike?

Isn't it dark by then?  Or do they light the loop?
