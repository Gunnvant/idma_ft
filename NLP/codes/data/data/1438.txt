Phillip,
 
I want to thank you for all of your work on managing the long term transport on El Paso.  You have done a great job.  Thanks for taking on the added responsibility.
 
Your contributions to the west desk and handling my bad positions will not be forgotten.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Grigsby
