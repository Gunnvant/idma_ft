Hello all,
 
I would greatly appreciate it if you could take 30 minutes out of your busy schedule to inform our marketing agency D'Arcy, who we have on retainer, about your view of Enron and the direction your business is moving. We are trying to get a better understanding of the issues Enron currently faces, to integrate them into future strategies. While this won't encompass specific marketing initiatives for your group, it will help with projects like the annual report and Corp marketing.
 
Louis Slotkin from D'Arcy will be conducting phone interviews on the following dates:September 28, October 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know when you would be able to speak with him. We want to work around your schedule, so please reply to Mireya Olsen so she can set up the calls.  

I REALLY appreciate it! Margaret
