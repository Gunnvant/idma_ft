Kalen - can you get him in here for an interview.

One of my close friends is looking for a job. He has been in strategy consulting for the last four years, first for Mckinsey and then for Accenture. He is a very smart guy and has great business sense. I have known him for a long time, great guy and can get things done. 
He is a business strategy and restructuing guru. Gurmeet had a baby and he is very keen in moving out of consulting. I am enclosing his resume here and I am going to take the liberty of asking him to give you a call. Will appreciate your taking a look.
