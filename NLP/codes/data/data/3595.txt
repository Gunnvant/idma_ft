Hi John,

I work in Corp. PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with 
respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to 
know the answer to.  I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are 
and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to 
French power trading.  I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance 
I would greatly appreciate your comments.  

Thanks, Ann
