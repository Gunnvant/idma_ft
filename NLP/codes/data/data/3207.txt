John,

I trust you have set a good example for all of us to follow by contributing 
20% of your gross income.  Don't let us down.

Dear fellows,
Please remember to fill out your pledge card for United Way (even if you 
don't plan on contributing)  if you haven't done so thus far.
Thanks,
John
