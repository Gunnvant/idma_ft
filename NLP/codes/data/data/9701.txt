Reminder:

The venue for the Board Meeting tonight has been changed to Chris Simon's
house so that you can work on Annual Fund letters before and/or after the
meeting.  The address is 4141 Oberlin Street, 77005.  It is in the west part
of West U off of Academy.  The phone number there if you get lost is

Annual Fund
It is so important to have as many handwritten notes on the Annual Fund
Letters as possible.  Therefore, the letters will be available for you to
make notes on tomorrow, January 17 and Friday, January 18 beginning at 8
a.m. until 6 p.m. at the Simon's house.  If you need to come later, contact
Kelley (832-824-2858) to make arrangements.  The letters are going out next
week, so all notes need to me done ASAP.


Camp Periwinkle Kick-off
The kick-off party/meeting for Camp Periwinkle will take place on Thursday,
January 31, at 6 p.m. at Jayne Finkowski-Rivera's house.  The address is
4807 Fern, 77401, between Bellaire Blvd. and Evergreen on the West side of
West Loop South.  Her phone number, if you get lost, is 713-667-6852.

Fun food and beverage, of course, will be provided.  Come casual and bring
your thinking caps to help us make Camp Periwinkle 2002 the best ever!
Believe me, this is where you begin to feel the excitement of camp, so join
us!

Thanks,
