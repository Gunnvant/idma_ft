I have been riding my bike to work a couple of times each week and lifting with Matt.  I thought you came in later.

are you still working out in the mornings?  i cannot find anyone to lift in the mornings.  let me know if you have been hitting it solo and could use a good spotter.  i finally got a bike rack put on my car.  gonna try and hit memorial this weekend.  have you been lately?
