  Market Participants:

  Pursuant to the ISO's Governing Board decision in October
1999 and FERC's ruling in March 2000, the ISO has begun releasing market bid
information, lagged by a six month period and without revealing the names of
bidders, beginning on August 1, 2000 for operating date February 1, 2000.
Bid data will be provided for the ISO's ancillary service markets, real-time
energy market, and congestion management market.

  These data can be found on the ISO's web site at
