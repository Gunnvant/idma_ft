Dear Harry,

It was really nice talking to you this week. I hope I could provide you with
information sufficient for making the right decision. From my side, I once
again want to highlight the fact that if I am given a chance, I will do all
I can to prove that the people who gave me this chance made the right
decision.

With best regards,
