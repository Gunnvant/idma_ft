John,

These are the following people that are eating daily lunches, that I'm sure can get away from their desk:

Fundamentals group under Chris Gaskill (18 people)
IT group under Colin Tonks (13 people)
Weather group (9 people)

The follwoing people are being charged directly to your cost center:
Amy Cavazos
Bharat Khanna
Bilal Bajwa
Elizabet Soto
Errol McLaughlin
Frnak Hayden
George Huan
Greg Couch
Joey Taylor
Kori Loibl
Laura Vargas
Luchas Johnson
Sean Riordan
Sherry Dawson

I am going to let all of these people know that beginning 7/1/01 the daily lunches will go back to being for the traders only due to cost and time.
 
Let me know if your okay with this.
Ina Rangel
