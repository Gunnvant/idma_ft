It appears that the only position under this CP's GTC expired in Feb02.  Therefore the only issue on Empire is the A/R of $210.00.  In our list we show this CP with a status of "expired."  No need to send termination letter.

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log - 
	Termination Letter column: Expired
	Comment column: $210 A/R outstanding

Thanks
