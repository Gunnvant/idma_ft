Hi,
 
     I'm still feeling weak.  Therefore, I won't be in today.
 
    If I'm not better by tomorrow, I'm going for a checkup.
 
    Hope all is well at Dynegy.
 
Regards,
Iris

Good morning,

 

     It seems that I have a virus/food poisoning and am unable to retain water and liquids.

 

     Hence I will not come in today.

 

    WIll you pass this message onto to Harry Arora, Rika Imai and Dave Forster.

 

Thanks,

Iris
