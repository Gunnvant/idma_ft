In case I did not find each of you personally, please be aware that as in the past with new Active X releases you will each be receiving the new version first. Each of you will have a new version of the website this evening, Friday November 16th. 

You should not notice any changes, but if you do experience any problems please call me. 

Thank you,

Lindsay
