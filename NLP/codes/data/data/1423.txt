Recently, we did a bank-wide computer conversion.  Unfortunately, the
conversion of internet data has taken longer than anticipated.  We have
dedicated two people to completing the internet conversion.

Bill Payer is active and available with balances being dated November 9,
2001.  Updating your internet banking balance is our highest priority.
We appreciate your patience.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
Network Administrator
