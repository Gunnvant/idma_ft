Hey freak:
So we finally had LA type weather here for the past two days.  Highs in the 
mid-70's.  Beautiful.  Life's just cruising along.  Nothing new.  I put a bid 
in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in West U that they 
accepted.  If all goes as expected I'll move in next X-Mas.  So are you 
adjusting to the big city.   Got yourself a big Hollywood actor boyfriend yet?
