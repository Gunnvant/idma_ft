Mark:
I looked into the payment.  Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do.  Everything has to get approved by lawyers and they can't pay a vendor arbitrarily.  I'll keep working on it.  Sorry.

What do you think of ng and cl here?

John:
 
The recent check from Enron ($9,000) has been returned  for nonpayment.  Any suggestions/ideas as to how to rectify this?  I'd  appreciate any input you may have.  Thanks,
