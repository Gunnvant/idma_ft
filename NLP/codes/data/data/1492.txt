
If you have any information you wish to be distributed to the class this  week, please get it to me before this upcoming Wednesday morning. Short text-bullet items are fine. I haven't been getting much information over the last 5-6 weeks, and I'm running out of class calendar entries....
You are receiving this because I have either you or your spouse listed  as a member of the leadership team for "The Way" Sunday school class at Second   Baptist Church. If you don't want to get weekly reminders, or have a spouse  email available, please let me know  .     
Regards,
