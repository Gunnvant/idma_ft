TSWG Distribution List:

ACTION REQUESTED by Friday, September 1, 2000 :  The ISO is developing an
updated E-mail distribution list for TSWG (Technical Standards Working
Group) IT (Information Technology) contacts. This E-mail distribution list
will be used for all IT related communications with our Market Participants.

Each Market Participant should confirm your present primary representative
or designate a new representative as it's principle contact or liaison for
TSWG.  All IT project technical communications will be focused through your
company's designated IT contact(s). The IT contact(s) should also be
available for the conference calls held on Wednesday afternoons.  Adjacent
Control Area transmission organizations are also requested to submit the
name of an IT representative.

Please e-mail your representative to jcole@caiso.com
