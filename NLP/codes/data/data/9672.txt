Dona,

Lets go with Sat. Lunch.  How about 1:00pm, or would early be better???

Yes, I remembered that Lilly was coming for visit in March -- thanks for letting know the exact date.

We must get together just the girls, as well as trying to see if Basil could join us for dinner, along with David & Steve.

Susan.
