My PAB file, or for the non technical among you, my Outlook Personal Address
Book was accidently deleted this week in an upgrade to Windows 2000 NT.
I have restored an old one, but it is several months, if not a whole year
out of date.
This is the first message to confirm the current address I have for you is
still active.
Please reply confirming you recieved it.
A second message will follow to try and replace some of the address's I know
I have lost.
Thanks for your help
Sean.
