Although I haven't forebid people from trading on other screens like ICE I have discouraged it.  A couple weeks ago, on his own, Presto pulled all their accounts.  The 20 trades or so that we are doing on ICE in Power are all coming from Portland.  On October 11th, Richter 8, Motley 5, Fischer 3, Crandall 3.  The reason we have been successful with EOL is because in November of 99 the whole industry felt like they could pick us off.  Sooner or later they were hooked.  I don't want us to get hooked on ICE.  Please help.
