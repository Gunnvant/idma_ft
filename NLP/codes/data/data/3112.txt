So, what did you think?!  Don't lie or stretch the truth either -- you won't 
hurt my feelings, I promise.  

By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for a 
three mile run this morning.  Not fun, but I'm definitely awake right now!  
BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he!

Trade well, MSA
