It appears that the only position under this CP's GTC expired in Mar02.  Therefore the only issue on TRC is the A/R of $275,466 (consisting of Jan02 invoice amount $132,370 and Mar02 invoice amount $143,096).  In our list we show this CP with a status of "expired."  No need to send termination letter.

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log - 
	Termination Letter column: Expired
	Comment column: $275,466 A/R outstanding.  On 3/12/02 Charles Comfort of TRC said TRC will pay the Jan02 invoice this month and will pay the Mar02 invoice in April.

Thanks
