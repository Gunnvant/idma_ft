Is AMF willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge June 29th as the day they were supposed to close  or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on July 18th?  Of course, I would prefer to close as soon as possible.  

I received the fax from the stagecoach.  I am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to April 20th.  What is the status of the release and the utility transfer?

The buyer wants to close on July 18 or 19th. According to the contract they
must close one month after all requirements have been met or put up an
additional $25,000 in NON-REFUNDABLE earnest money.  The zoning was approved
on May 29.

However, the official zoning designation has not been done yet and may not
be approved until around the 1st of Aug.  Give me a call when you get back.
