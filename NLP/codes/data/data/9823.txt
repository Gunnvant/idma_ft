

Diane or Patrick,

I need help from one of you in connection with providing copies of the Confirmation(s) for the following Counterparties:

				Boise Cascade Corporation
				Dial Corporation (The)
				Lin Pac, Inc.
				Master Packaging (N.B.) Inc.
				Norske Skog Canada Limited 
				Rand-Whitney Container Board, L.P.


ENA does not have a master in place for the above-mentioned, therefore, the confirmations, will provide the information needed for review.
In light of this, please make sure your Confirmation copy includes the GTC.   Further, please provide a copy of all confirmations for those trades which are live, active and on the books.


This request must be handled on an immediate basis, so could we have the copies by the close of business today -- January 16th.

Thanks,

Susan
