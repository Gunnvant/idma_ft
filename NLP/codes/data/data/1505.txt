
To Accenture:

As discussed early today we hereby notify Accenture of 10 days notice of intent to terminate our Arrangement Letter for development of Basics of Risk Management.  The 10 days count down begins as of this evening.

During these 10 days Accenture and Enron will review its position and attempt to find a solution for this project to go forward.
