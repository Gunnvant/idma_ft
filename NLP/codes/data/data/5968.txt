Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John
