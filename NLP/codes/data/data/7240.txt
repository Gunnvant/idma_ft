Ted:
Lavorato wanted me to check on the $5,000,000 VAR extension.  Is it possible 
to get this extended indefinitely until the west basis market settles down?  
We will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next 
week as well as indices get published.  Please advise ASAP.
