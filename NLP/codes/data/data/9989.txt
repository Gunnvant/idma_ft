It looks like facility charges are covered 1/2000 forward by the individual 
deals.  Mick does not think there are any other outstanding issues for 
transport as a methodology has been established and agreed upon for 1/2000 
forward.

Thanks.  Yes I would like for you to add the facilities charges.  
Additionally, will you work with Mick Walters to add his issues also?

Attached is a listing of unresolved Issues between Tom and Greg Sharp.  I 
have not included the facility charges - do you want me to add those?

Please feel free to add on to my list anything that I have left off.
