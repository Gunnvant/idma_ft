Elizabeth/Carol:

Can you confirm if the attached includes all of the pre-bankruptcy terminations agreed with counreparties? Should we check with any of the other lawyers going to UBS?

Elizabeth: You had mentioned in your transition memo/list that Sempra had agreed to a termination, and that there was a dispute on the return of our collateral. I do not see them on the list. Could you advise further on this?

Thanks, Alan

As you requested, I am attaching my list of pre-petition mutual terminations (as well as 3 post-petition mutual terminations).  This list is located in excel in my misc. directory.  As per your direction, I will also deliver my binder of mutual terminations to Susan Bailey.
