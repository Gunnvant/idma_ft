It only takes about 10 minutes to get to highland village from here.  I can 
go anytime between 11-1ish.  
Not too much exciting going on here.  I did start somewhat of a new position 
today - expanded responsibilities.  I went up to the trading floor this 
morning.  I will be doing half days from now on.

What was that supposed to mean?????????/  I would like to go to lunch as
well.  I'll let you know when is a good day, but it looks like next week
might be better!  What time can you go?  How far is the drive for you?  I'm
glad Michael is still doing well.  He tried to talk me out of law school in
the 30 seconds I talked to him on Sunday.  He did a good job.  Just kidding.
Keep me posted on a good day for you and I'll do the same.  Anything
exciting going on today?
