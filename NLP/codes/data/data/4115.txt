sure, stop by and we'll arrange a place to meet.  If you come by  during 
trading hours though, I can only say hi for a couple seconds.

That sounds fine. Would you like to meet at your office and go from there?
By the way, I will be in your office earlier in the afternoon for a meeting.
Perhaps I can stop over to say hello.  ----- Original Message -----
