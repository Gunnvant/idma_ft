Subject:	Simulation Common Mistakes

Phillip,

I have attached a list of the Common Mistakes we have compiled for the Risk
Management Simulation. We thought this would be a good starting point for
our discussion of examples and scenarios at next Tuesday's meeting. Any
stories you have related to these mistakes will be extremely helpful.
During the meeting, we can also get from you the names of anyone else who
might be able to provide us with good examples of these mistakes.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Mery
