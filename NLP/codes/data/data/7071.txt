most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.
