Colleen,

I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on 
January 2nd versus February 11:

   1/2  2/11

Stanfield to Malin 209  81

SJ/Perm. to Socal 896  251

Sj to Socal  2747  768

PGE/Top to Citygate 51  3

PGE/Top to KRS 16  4

SJ to Valero  916  927


If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value 
since the beginning of the year.  Can you confirm that I am looking at the 
right numbers?


Phillip
