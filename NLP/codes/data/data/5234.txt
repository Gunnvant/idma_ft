	The Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating UNIX home directories and applications to new hardware on October 13 and 14, 	2001.  The migration will begin on Saturday the 13th at 7:00 PM and will be completed by 1:00 AM on Sunday, October 14, 2001.

	The migration requires a total system outage; so home directories and applications will not be available during the above time 	period.  Please log off before you leave for the weekend.
	Development teams members will test migrated applications on Sunday, October 14, 2001.

	If you encounter or observe abnormal behavior with any application used in your normal course of business, please contact the 	resolution center at 713-853-1411.  The resolution center can escalate to the appropriate resource.
