Greetings;

The attached document outlines the changes in meter data polling being
implemented effective  8/31/00 for ISO polled meters. The data will change
to 10 minute intervals in support of the 10-minute settlement process.

Please review the attached document with particular attention to the changes
on August 31, 2000.

At this time, there will be no change to SC submitted SQMD.
