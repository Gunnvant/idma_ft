  Market Participants:

  As part of the Congestion Management Reform Proposal, the
ISO has posted Appendix B "Locational Price Dispersion Study" on the ISO web
site at http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> .  Please be aware
that the file is very large (the Word version is 5.1 mb and the PDF version
is somewhat smaller at 4.3 mb) so it will take a while to download.
