
Paul,

I need to ask that you furnish an executed version of the ISDA Master Agreement dated effective March 6, 1998, between ECTRIC and J. Aron & Company.

We are trying to work through some matters and a copy of this ISDA is essential.

An electronic version if available would be great.

Thanks.
 
Cordially,
