Change of Plans!

We have moved the Board Meeting on Wednesday night at 6pm to
Chris and Judy Simon's house at 4141 Oberlin.  We're going to
give you a chance to kill two birds with one stone.  
We will have the annual fund letters there for you to put 
personal notes on so you won't have to make a second trip.  
(We know we're already asking for a lot of your time this week.)
Plan to come early before the meeting and/or stay after to sign
your letters.  Judy will have wine and hors d'ouvres.   

Thank you again for all you do!
