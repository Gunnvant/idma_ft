we maybe slow, but we eventually get there,,

as you know Carr has been trying to get approval from within and from Enron
finance people to create margin financing to execute & clear Nymex (and
e-nymex too) business for Enron. Well we are finally there..
We would love the opportunity to renew our realtionship of executing and/or
clearing for you again.
We are told (by Sarah) that you would have to talk to your individual
finance person to get the particulars of this, but she told us that we are
basically approved.. If you have any question about this , please call..
Other than that any assistance we could be to help in this , let us know..
 definitely looking forward to this opportunity to do business again.
