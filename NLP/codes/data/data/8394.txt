
Hi,
I'm working with Dave Forster to put together an Originator's Toolkit, that will contain a description of various products (many from Janelle's Product Descriptions) that the originators and mid marketers can offer customers.  Since many of the products are option based I'd like to run the toolkit by you all to look over.  I'd appreciate any comments.  Also if there are any additional products that I should add please let me know.
Thanks,
Max
