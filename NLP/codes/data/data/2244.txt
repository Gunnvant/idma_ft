Erik,

All of the desk heads are leaving for an offsite this afternoon through this weekend.  Monday would be better.  I would like to schedule meetings for you with several people on the gas floor.  I will have Ina Rangel arrange this for Monday afternoon.

Phillip,

I wanted to try to set up an appointment with you regarding any opportunities on the gas desk.

I have worked for Jean Mrha, Greg Woulfe and Jim Fallon managing the advertising trading in EBS and formerly on the Coal desk for Dan Reck and George McClellan.

How does your schedule look this afternoon or Friday?

Thanks for your time,

Erik Simpson
