Jeff and Bob, 

At Tradition's request, I put together a one-page explanation of CAISO Firm 
Energy.  I thought you might find it handy to have it to hand when discussing 
this with counterparties.

Here is the explanation for CAISO Firm Energy.  As discussed, if asked, 
please tell people that it was prepared by a market participant at 
Tradition's request.  I'd rather keep Enron's name out of it.

Thank you in advance for helping us with this. 

Shari
