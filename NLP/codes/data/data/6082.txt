Team, 

Attached is the newest EBS orgchart, updated 2 days ago.  They have made some 
interesting changes.


Also, you can click on the URL below to go to the EBS intranet site, where 
you will find all sorts of information related to EBS, its market and 
competition, etc.  As a "high-tech" company, they actually do keep this 
updated very frequently, unlike some of the other Enron internal web sites.

(you will find Norm Levine's market/comp info here, as well)
