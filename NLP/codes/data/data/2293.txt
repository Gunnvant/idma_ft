Horrible events this week!!  Hope you did not know anyone involved.
Thought I would share my recent accomplishment with you, given you have
pretty much known me since I did my first Triathlon at Cinco Ranch about 4
years ago now I believe.  Did my first ironman last Saturday up at Lake
Geneva in Wisconsin.  Very long day and the hardest thing I have ever done,
but I finished which was my ultimate goal.

I would gladly trade it in to bring back some of the lost souls from
Tuesday, but unfortunately I do not have that power.

Hope everything is splendid with you.  Talk to you soon,
