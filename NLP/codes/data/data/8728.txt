Sir,
 For the month of August, 2000, we will take 50% of our open Block Forward 
position financial instead of physical. We would like to make this change 
because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us 
commercially. Thus for bona fide commercial reasons, we will go financial 
with 50% of our open Block Forward position.
