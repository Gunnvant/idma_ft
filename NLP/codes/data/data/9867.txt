Edward,

As promised, attached is the third & final installment with respect to electronic versions available for those "Master Netting Agreements", which were included in the binder delivered to Raj last week.  The counterparties included in this final installment are:

1.	BP Amoco

 

2.	Calpine

 

3.	Constellation

 

4.	Dynegy

 


5.	Reliant

 

By receipt of this transmission, you are now in possession of all the electonic/pdf formatted Master Netting Agreements, which were included in the binder delivered to Raj last week.  

One note of clarification -- I have provided the electronic/pdf version of the Florida Power & Light Company agreement.  However, at the time the binder was delivered this agreement had not come my way; therefore, it is not included in the current binder is scheduled to be included a supplemental binder.

Please advise if I may be of further assistance.

Cordially,
