Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe 
d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....

Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to 
have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll 
see you guys there.

Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's 
the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again 
soon....

Take care!
Amy
