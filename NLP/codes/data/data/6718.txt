I actually went to go talk to him yesterday but he was already gone and he's on vacation today.  I'll talk to him next week.  Probably better for him to hear the benfits from my mouth.  We do need to talk to him before we get too far.  
 
EOL working very well as of late.

I have not spoken to Lavo about the potential eNYMEX deal where you are a specialist, etc.  I know you and Richter are back working on it but let me know if you want me to speak to him about it or if you want to do it or if you think we should wait awhile.
 
Everything else OK with EOL, etc.?
 
Thanks.
