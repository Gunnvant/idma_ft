The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.
