Ed:
I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks.  As we discussed earlier, I 
don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, 
such as when I'm out of the office.  As such, I'd like to bring in John 
Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with 
your permission.
