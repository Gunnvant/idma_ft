I have arranged a conference bridge number for the Friday staff meeting for 
the individuals that might have difficulty with video conference equipment or 
will be on travel status and not available at the office.  

As a reminder the staff meeting is scheduled at 2:30 pm Central time.  

The conference bridge number is:

Domestic 1-800-713-8600
International 1-801-983-4017

Pass Number 03151

If you have any questions, please let me know!
