Hello:
It is the Blue Men Group.  Two friends highly recommend it.  It's in the 
Astor Theatre on Lafayette in the Village.
43rd should be good.  I think you woul dhave had more flavor in Harlem though

I've been tasked with getting tickets to a show.  Was it 'Blue Men Group'
that you recommended we see?  And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not
as bad as you thought.
