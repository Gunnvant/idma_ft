Jeff, 

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Phillip

The kuo's are having their attorney look at the agreement.  They need to
transfer their onwership into a LLP with your consent before they can sign
the agreement.  Pauline is contacting the bank for their consent also.  You
may need to sign a consent form to transfer the LLP.  I will keep you
posted.
