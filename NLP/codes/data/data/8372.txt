Harry:

Long time no hear. I can imagine you must be pretty busy these days. So how 
is the summer shaping up. Are u guys going on a vacation this last week 
before the Fall term starts? Enron has been in the news quite a lot 
recently. Jeff Skilling's leaving the company was quite a shocker.

As for me, I finally received my H1-B visa. As you know I am currently 
living temporarily with my sister in NJ and am moving to Boston Sept 1. I 
had a few questions to ask you and also take u up on your offer of helping 
me with the GC processing.

1) Do I have to goto Vancouver to get my H1-B visa from the US consulate in 
Vancouver. I had given my Vancouver address on my visa application and the 
notice from INS says the the Vancouver consulate is the one that will 
process my visa. I was wondering since I am in NJ, I could drive down to TO 
or Ottawa easily.

2) Can you give me the contact details of the lawyer you used for the GC 
under the E-11 category and also how much would she charge for the GC 
application. Also what do i have to gather in terms of documents and also do 
I have to get a letter from the employer?

Say my hello to your parents and Nicole. Hope to hear from you soon.

Harnek 'Nik' Minhas
