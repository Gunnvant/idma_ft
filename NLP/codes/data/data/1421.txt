[IMAGE]  =09 2002 Toyota Camry XLE:  Best-Selling Style and Refinement     =
 The Toyota Camry casts a long shadow on the U.S. car market. It was  intro=
duced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known=
 for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  gene=
rations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to =
include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyer=
s as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's b=
est-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned =
on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four=
-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and co=
nvertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and =
more personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE t=
o find out if Toyota hit  its mark.      Full  Review   > >      You are  r=
