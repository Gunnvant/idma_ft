
Kerri, 

As discussed, set forth below is the list of the Non-Terminated Top Ten Counterparties, where Enron is In-The-Money.  First determine where if applicable in your respective confirm world whether the appropriate Enron affiliate has a (i) physical power, or (ii) financial power relationship with each of the counterparties listed.  If so, please furnish a listing that evidences the following requests:

	1.	Live Deals as of November 30, 2001
	2.	Expired Deals since November 30, 2001
	3.	New Deals since November 30, 2001

Also, please furnish a hard copy of all live confirmations under request #1 above.  

I beleive that Melissa has already furnished the physical power confirms for those mentioned above.  However, ask her if she has searched for financial power deals.

If not we will need these for any of the above-mentioned.

Many thanks,
