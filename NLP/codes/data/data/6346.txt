Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable "what's in it for me" questions.

Sincerely,
Jim Wininger
