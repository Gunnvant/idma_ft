John,
Is there a man by the name of Henry (Dutch) Quigley who will be working in 
your group?  His name was not on the list I sent to you previously,
but he showed up on another list from HR as being assigned to your group.  
Please let me know and I will make any necessary adjustments
to your cost center for him.

Thank you,
Edie Leschber
