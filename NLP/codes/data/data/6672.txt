Based on questions I have received, I wanted to make sure everyone had the same information in preparing their bid on the American Rice natural gas RFP.
 
American Rice holds transportation on Dow moving gas from the various pipeline interconnects with Dow at Katy to their facility in Freeport. ARI will give you monthly nominations and be responsible for imbalances on Dow.  If you provide an index related price, we would like the option to convert it to a fixed price at our option.
 
I hope this helps you in your bid preparation.  Proposals are due September 20, 2001.  Thank you for your consideration.
