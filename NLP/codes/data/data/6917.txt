AND ONE MORE....GLOBAL NEEDS TO SELL 50/MTH APR-OCT 02 NG SWAPS.

THEY ARE WONDERING IF:
A) IF WE KNOW WHO WE ORIGINALLY OFFSET THEIR TRADES WITH- COULD
THEY CALL THEM DIRECT AND WE WILL "REASSIGN" THE TRADE. SO NO NE
T CHANGE TO YOUR CURRENT POSTION.

B) IF WE ARE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY OFFSET TODAYS TRADES WITH SOME
ONE, COULD THEY CONFERENCE ALL OF US TO AGREE ON A PRICE FOR THE
M TO TRADE WITH BOTH CPTYS.

C) IF THEIR TRADES TODAY NATURALLY HELP OUR BOOK, THEY WILL TRY
TO CALL SOMEONE TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY EAT BID/OFFER.
