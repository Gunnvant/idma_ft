I'm sorry but I have plans for Thursday already.  Maybe next time.

John,
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday.  If, as we
discussed yesterday, you have time to get out after work, I'd like to
get together.  Please let me know if this works for you and I'll confirm
my plans to be there.
Thanks,
Jim Naughton
